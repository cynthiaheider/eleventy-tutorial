Left off: 
Created this from the eleventy-base template. Moved all the posts from the Glitch instance which will go away soon. Installed Bootstrap CSS and Icons. Began reconstructing the site to have as a demo for show. Pulled in some stock images. Made notes about the process and what will need to be changed in the tutorial itself as well as the eleventy-base repo. Notes are in Obsidian, linked on this date.

Next:
See notes in Obsidian, linked from this date. There are a lot of files in here that have layouts in their frontmatter that don't exist yet (I decided to make the layouts again as a reminder to myself and to beef up the tutorial). I have largely been doing that in the index.html file so that I can see changes without needing to build the site.
